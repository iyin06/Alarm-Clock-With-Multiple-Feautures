The digital alarm clock can switch between two modes—clock mode and stopwatch mode—by pressing a button. An alarm time is  set, and when the current time matches the alarm time, the buzzer sounds, playing a melody. Simultaneously, the LCD displays the real-time, and when the alarm goes off, it shows a personalized wake-up message, while the LEDs blink in sync with the alarm melody. Pressing the button silences the buzzer and stops the LEDs from blinking. A separate button activates the snooze function, displaying a message that the alarm has been snoozed for a set duration. Once the snooze period ends, the alarm rings again with a new personalized message and synchronized LED blinking. The stopwatch allows us to start, stop, and reset the timer. Pressing the mode button toggles between clock and stopwatch modes, with the LCD displaying a notification for each mode change to enhance user experience.
